2. What is path MTU? How is it discovered? How does this affect your code for TCP and UDP?


Path MTU discovery(max transmission unit) to find max size on network path to prevent ip fragmentation

ip frag is when your max size is like 10kb per unit and u have a 100kb file so it has to break it up to send thru 
and then reassembled by the host



in TCP: ip frag can cause TCP to resend ALL fragments if you los one
otherwise UDP?? probably dont care


sets Dont Fragment flag in IP header of packets
any device along path whose MTU is smaller will drop it and send it back ICMP "frag needed and its MTU", 
then source host reduces its path MTU

tldr;
Sets the Dont fragment flag on ip headers;
so as a packet goes down the path if it encounters soemhing that cant take that big of a MTU
it sends a msg back to the host with its max size and gets resized to that
